Pet A: Gecko
Gecko Info
"Little kids love the gecko because he just sits there in your hand," says Dr. Mackey. "They’re a cool, cool lizard. They’re the softest animal you will ever touch. Feet stick to the glass on the container. But, they’re nocturnal. You can see them during the daytime, but the evening/early morning is the best time to see them."

Once you start handling them, you must be very gentle, because geckos will "drop" (lose) their tails if startled or made to feel threatened.

You must wash your hands after handling your gecko because reptiles tend to carry Salmonella bacteria more frequently than some other species of pets.

Pet B: Parakeet
Parakeet Info
Parakeets are known to be very affectionate, and they respond well to regular, gentle handling. With training, a parakeet can learn dozens or more words, so you can actively engage with them in a fun and unique way.

When it comes to the everyday care of a parakeet, you can help out with tasks like washing and filling up the food and water dish and feeding vegetables as a treat.

Pet C: Dog
Dog Info
You can take responsibility for a variety of care tasks for a pet dog. Younger kids can give fresh food and water and wash towels and bedding, and tweens and teens can take dogs out on walks, and even help out with teeth brushing.

Dogs can live to be well over 10 years old (some for 20 years or even more), so they are long-term commitments.

Pet D: Snake
Snake Info
"Corn snakes can be very gentle," says Dr. Hess.

The corn snake can grow to be 2.5-5 feet, so you will need to adjust their terrarium size as they grow. They are great starter reptiles for older children because they do not mind being handled. They do require rodents as food, but they should be freshly deceased or frozen, because live mice can injure your pet snake.

Corn snakes have a life span of 5-10 years, so they are long-term commitments.
