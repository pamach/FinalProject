Hooray! Your pet match is:
Dog
Here is some information about your pet match:
Dog Info
You can take responsibility for a variety of care tasks for a pet dog. Younger kids can give fresh food and water and wash towels and bedding, and tweens and teens can take dogs out on walks, and even help out with teeth brushing.

Dogs can live to be well over 10 years old (some for 20 years or even more), so they are long-term commitments.

Hooray! Your pet match is:
Snake
Here is some information about your pet match:
Snake Info
"Corn snakes can be very gentle," says Dr. Hess.

The corn snake can grow to be 2.5-5 feet, so you will need to adjust their terrarium size as they grow. They are great starter reptiles for older children because they do not mind being handled. They do require rodents as food, but they should be freshly deceased or frozen, because live mice can injure your pet snake.

Corn snakes have a life span of 5-10 years, so they are long-term commitments.
